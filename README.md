# Build ML Models for Customer Conversions

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for customer feedback analysis using Snowflake's ML capabilities and Cortex AI. The application processes multilingual customer reviews, extracts sentiment using Cortex AI, classifies review quality using transformers, and builds an XGBoost model to predict purchase decisions. You'll also learn how to set up automated workflows with Snowflake's DAG functionality for continuous model retraining and deployment, all with unified governance across the application stack.
